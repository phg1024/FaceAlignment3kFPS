This is a face recognition library. Merged to the libface and re written from scratch.

After some testing it responds to about +-50 in lit variation and only +-6
degrees in rotation. Hope is Fisher face will make it better.

To install run:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make
make install

This will attempt to build the library and install in /usr/lib and /usr/include/libface,
or if you have a 64bit system, it will attempt to install into lib64.

You need at least OpenCV 2.1 that includes the file FindOpenCV.cmake, for Debian.

An example of use of libface library can be found in examples directory.

Compile programs that use libface with the linking option -lface

NOTE: As of June 2010, Mandriva ships opencv split into multiple packages. You MUST install the opencv-samples package.
